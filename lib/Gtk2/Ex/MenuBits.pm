=head1 NAME

Gtk2::Ex::MenuBits -- miscellaneous Gtk2::Menu helpers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Gtk2::Ex::MenuBits;

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item C<< ($x,$y,$push_in) = Gtk2::Ex::MenuBits::position_widget_topcentre ($menu, $x, $y, $userdata) >>

Position a menu with its top edge centred in a given C<$userdata> widget.
This is good for a menu popped up by a keystroke in a "strip" type widget
which is wide but has only a small height.

    $menu->popup (undef,    # no parent menushell
                  undef,    # no parent menuitem
                  \&Gtk2::Ex::MenuBits::position_widget_topcentre,
                  $widget,  # userdata
                  0,        # no button for keyboard popup
                  $event_time);

C<$userdata> can be either a widget or a reference to a widget.  The latter
can be a weak reference so as to avoid a circular reference between a widget
and a menu within it (C<< $menu->popup >> holds C<$userdata> within the menu
for later C<reposition>).

If C<$userdata> is C<undef> or a ref to C<undef>, or if the widget is not
mapped or is on a different screen than C<$menu>, then the return is the
given C<$x>,C<$y> input parameters.  This is the mouse pointer position if
called straight from C<Gtk2::Menu>.

A multi-screen program should C<set_screen> on the menu to ensure it's the
same as the widget.  This is left to the application because it's probably
not safe within the positioning function, especially not if the positioning
is called from C<set_screen> itself due to moving a popped-up menu to a
different screen.

In the current implementation if the widget is in an iconified toplevel then
the position is based on its un-iconified location.  The intention in the
future is to go to the mouse position fallback in this case, since the
widget is not on-screen.  Of course when iconified a widget won't get
keyboard or button events to cause a menu popup, so in practice this doesn't
arise.

=head2 Mnemonic Strings

=over

=item C<$mstr = Gtk2::Ex::MenuBits::mnemonic_escape ($str)>

Return C<$str> with underscores doubled.  This can be used to ensure C<$str>
will appear as-is in a "mnemonic" type label etc.  For example,

    Gtk2::Ex::MenuBits::mnemonic_undo ("Some_Thing_XYZ")
    # gives "Some__Thing__XYZ"

=item C<$str = Gtk2::Ex::MenuBits::mnemonic_undo ($mstr)>

Return C<$mstr> with "_" underscore mnemonic markers removed.  This is how
C<$mstr> would appear, without the underlining implied by the "_" marker.

Doubled underscores "__" mean a literal single underscore.  So for example,

    Gtk2::Ex::MenuBits::mnemonic_undo ("Save _As X__Y__Z")
    # gives "Save As X_Y_Z"

=back

=head1 EXPORTS

Nothing is exported by default, but C<position_widget_topcentre> can be
requested in usual C<Exporter> style,

    use Gtk2::Ex::MenuBits 'position_widget_topcentre';
    $menu->popup (undef, undef,
                  \&position_widget_topcentre, $widget,
                  0, 0);

There's no C<:all> tag since this module is meant as a grab-bag of functions
and to import as-yet unknown things would be asking for name clashes!
