=head1 NAME

Gtk2::Ex::TreeModelBits - miscellaneous TreeModel helpers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Gtk2::Ex::TreeModelBits;

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item C<@types = Gtk2::Ex::TreeModelBits::all_column_types ($model)>

Return a list of all the column types in C<$model>.  For example to create
another ListStore with the same types as an existing one,

    my $new_store = Gtk2::ListStore->new
      (Gtk2::Ex::TreeModelBits::all_column_types ($old_store));

=item C<@values = Gtk2::Ex::TreeModelBits::column_contents ($model, $col)>

Return a list of all the values in column number C<$col> of a
C<Gtk2::TreeModel> object C<$model>.

Any tree structure in the model is flattened out for the return.  A parent
row's column value comes first, followed by the column values from its
children, recursively, as per C<< $model->foreach >>.

=item C<Gtk2::Ex::TreeModelBits::remove_matching_rows ($store, $subr, ...)>

Remove from C<$store> all rows passing C<$subr>.  C<$store> can be a
C<Gtk2::TreeStore>, a C<Gtk2::ListStore>, or another type with the same
style C<< $store->remove >> method.  C<$subr> is called

    $want_remove = &$subr ($store, $iter, ...)

where C<$iter> is the row being considered, and any extra arguments to
C<remove_matching_rows> are passed on to C<$subr>.  C<$subr> should return
true if it wants to remove the row.

The order rows are considered and removed is unspecified except that a
parent row is tested before its children, and the children of course are not
tested if the parent is removed.

If you use an old Gtk 2.0.x and might pass a C<Gtk2::ListStore> or
C<Gtk2::TreeStore> to C<remove_matching_rows> then get Perl-Gtk 1.240 or
higher to have the C<remove> method on those classes return a flag the same
as in Gtk 2.2 and up.  Otherwise on those stores C<remove_matching_rows>
will stop after the first row removed.

=item C<$iter = Gtk2::Ex::TreeModelBits::iter_prev ($model, $iter)>

Return a new C<Gtk2::TreeIter> which is the row preceding the given
C<$iter>, at the same depth.  If C<$iter> is the first element at its depth
then the return is C<undef>.

This is like a reverse of C<iter_next>.  Going to the previous row is not a
native operation and might be a touch slow if a model uses say a linked list
and so must chase through data for a path lookup.

=head1 EXPORTS

Nothing is exported by default, but the functions can be requested in usual
C<Exporter> style,

    use Gtk2::Ex::TreeModelBits 'remove_matching_rows';
    remove_matching_rows ($store, sub { ... });

There's no C<:all> tag since this module is meant as a grab-bag of functions
and to import as-yet unknown things would be asking for name clashes.
