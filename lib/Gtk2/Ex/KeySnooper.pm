=head1 NAME

Gtk2::Ex::KeySnooper -- keyboard snooper as object

=for test_synopsis my ($mydata);

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Gtk2::Ex::KeySnooper;
 my $snooper = Gtk2::Ex::KeySnooper->new (\&myfunc, $mydata);

 # myfunc disconnected when object destroyed
 $snooper = undef;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A C<Gtk2::Ex::KeySnooper> object installs a given function as a key snooper
in the Gtk main loop and when the KeySnooper object is destroyed it removes
that function.  The idea is that it can be easier to manage the lifespan of
an object than to keep an integer ID safe somewhere and remember
C<< Gtk2->key_snooper_remove >> at the right places.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item C<< $ks = Gtk2::Ex::KeySnooper->new ($func) >>

=item C<< $ks = Gtk2::Ex::KeySnooper->new ($func, $userdata) >>

Create and return a KeySnooper object calling the given C<$func>.  The calls
made are the same as C<< Gtk2->key_snooper_install >>, ie.

    $stop = &$func ($widget,$event,$userdata)

where C<$func> should return true if it wants to stop event processing,
ie. to consume the event, or false to let it propagate to other handlers
(the same as event signal handler returns, and you can use
C<Gtk2::EVENT_STOP> and C<Gtk2::EVENT_PROPAGATE> in Gtk2-Perl 1.220 and up).
For example,

    my $snooper = Gtk2::Ex::KeySnooper->new (\&myfunc, $mydata);

    sub myfunc {
      my ($widget, $event, $userdata) = @_;
      if ($event->type eq 'key-press') {
        if ($event->keyval == MY_DESIRED_KEYVAL) {
          do_something();
          return 1;  # don't propagate event further
        }
      } else {
        # key release
        ...
      }
      return 0;  # propagate event
    }

=item C<< $snooper->remove() >>

Remove the snooper function, if not already removed.  This is done
automatically when C<$snooper> is destroyed, but you can do it explicitly
sooner if desired.
