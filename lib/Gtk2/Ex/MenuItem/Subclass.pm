=head1 NAME

Gtk2::Ex::MenuItem::Subclass -- help for subclassing Gtk2::MenuItem

=for test_synopsis our @ISA

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 package My::MenuItem;
 use Glib::Object::Subclass 'Gtk2::MenuItem';

 use Gtk2::Ex::MenuItem::Subclass;
 unshift @ISA, 'Gtk2::Ex::MenuItem::Subclass';

 # then in an application
 my $item1 = My::MenuItem->new ('_Foo');
 my $item2 = My::MenuItem->new_with_label ('Bar');
 my $item3 = My::MenuItem->new_with_mnemonic ('_Quux');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Gtk2::Ex::MenuItem::Subclass> helps subclasses of C<Gtk2::MenuItem>.  It
provides versions of the following class methods

    new
    new_with_label
    new_with_mnemonic

which behave like the base C<Gtk2::MenuItem> methods but create a widget of
the given subclass, not merely a C<Gtk2::MenuItem> like the wrapped C code
does.  This is designed as a multiple inheritance mix-in.  For example,

    package My::MenuItem;
    use Glib::Object::Subclass 'Gtk2::MenuItem',
       signals => { ... },
       properties => [ ... ];

    # prepend to prefer this new() etc
    use Gtk2::Ex::MenuItem::Subclass;
    unshift @ISA, 'Gtk2::Ex::MenuItem::Subclass';

Then in application code create a C<My::MenuItem> widget with

    my $item = My::MenuItem->new ('_Foo');

C<$item> is created as a C<My::MenuItem>, as the call would suggest.
Similarly C<new_with_label> and C<new_with_mnemonic>.

The same can be done when subclassing from C<Gtk2::CheckMenuItem> too.

=head2 C<ISA> order

The C<unshift @ISA> shown above ensures C<Gtk2::Ex::MenuItem::Subclass> is
before the C<new_with_label> and C<new_with_mnemonic> from
C<Gtk2::MenuItem>, and also before the C<new> from
C<Glib::Object::Subclass>.  The effect is

    @ISA = ('Gtk2::Ex::MenuItem::Subclass',
            'Glib::Object::Subclass',
            'Gtk2::MenuItem',
            'Gtk2::Item',
            'Gtk2::Bin',
            ...)

If you want the key/value C<new()> from C<Glib::Object::Subclass> rather
than the label-string one then put C<Gtk2::Ex::MenuItem::Subclass> just
after C<Glib::Object::Subclass>, like

    # for key/value new() per plain Glib::Object
    @ISA = ('Glib::Object::Subclass',
            'Gtk2::Ex::MenuItem::Subclass',
            'Gtk2::MenuItem',
            'Gtk2::Item',
            ...)

All C<@ISA> setups are left to the subclassing package because the order can
be important and it can be confusing if too many C<use> things muck about
with it.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item C<< $item = $class->new () >>

=item C<< $item = $class->new ($str) >>

Create and return a new menu item widget of C<$class>.  If a C<$str>
argument is given then this behaves as C<new_with_mnemonic> below.

=item C<< $item = $class->new_with_label () >>

=item C<< $item = $class->new_with_label ($str) >>

Create and return a new menu item widget of C<$class>.  If a C<$str>
argument is given then a C<Gtk2::AccelLabel> child is created and added to
display that string.  C<$str> should not be C<undef>.

If there's no C<$str> argument then C<new_with_label> behaves the same as
plain C<new> and doesn't create a child widget.

=item C<< $item = $class->new_with_mnemonic () >>

=item C<< $item = $class->new_with_mnemonic ($str) >>

Create and return a new menu item widget of C<$class>.  If a C<$str>
argument is given then a C<Gtk2::AccelLabel> child is created and added to
display that string.  An underscore in the string becomes an underline and
keyboard shortcut, eg. "_Edit" for underlined "E".  C<$str> should not be
C<undef>.

If there's no C<$str> argument then C<new_with_mnemonic> behaves the same as
plain C<new> and doesn't create a child widget.

=back

For Gtk 2.16 and up C<new_with_label> simply sets the C<label> property and
C<new_with_mnemonic> sets the C<label> and C<use-underline> properties.  For
earlier versions an explicit C<Gtk2::AccelLabel> creation is done as per
past code in C<gtk_menu_item_new_with_label()> and
C<gtk_menu_item_new_with_mnemonic()>.

For reference, it doesn't work to re-bless the return from the MenuItem
widgets from the base C<new_with_label> and C<new_with_mnemonic> into a new
subclass.  Doing so changes the Perl hierarchy but doesn't change the
underlying C code object C<GType> and therefore doesn't get new properties
or signals from the subclass.

=head1 OTHER WAYS TO DO IT

When running on Gtk 2.16 the C<label> property can be used instead of
C<new_with_label> and so in a subclass there's no particular need to have
the separate C<new_with_label>.

    package My::MenuItem;
    use Glib::Object::Subclass 'Gtk2::MenuItem';

    # then in the application
    my $item = My::MenuItem->new (label => 'Hello');

But the benefit of C<Gtk2::Ex::MenuItem::Subclass> is that you don't leave
exposed a C<new_with_label> which does the wrong thing, and it can work on
Gtk prior to 2.16.
