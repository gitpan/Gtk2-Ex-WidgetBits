=head1 NAME

Gtk2::Ex::WidgetEvents -- event mask merging for widgets

=for test_synopsis my ($widget)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Gtk2::Ex::WidgetEvents;
 my $wm = Gtk2::Ex::WidgetEvents->new ($widget, ['motion-notify-mask']);

 my $we = Gtk2::Ex::WidgetEvents->new ($widget);
 $we->add (['motion-notify-mask','exposure-mask']);
 $we->remove ('exposure-mask');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

WidgetEvents represents an event mask wanted on a particular widget for an
add-on feature or semi-independent widget component.  The event mask on the
widget's window is the union of WidgetEvents masks and the widget's base
mask.

The plain GtkWidget C<add_events> is geared towards permanent additions to
the event mask.  Often this is enough.  But for removing mask bits to clean
up after a widget add-on it's important to check whether anyone else is
still interested in those events.  WidgetEvents keeps track of that.

Turning event mask bits on and off is mostly a matter of optimization.  For
example it does no great harm to have mouse motion events left on, but it's
wasteful.  Sometimes it's important for event propagation rules to have an
event turned off when unwanted, so for example a button press can go up to a
parent window instead.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

In the following functions C<$mask> can be any of the usual Glib flags
forms, meaning an actual C<Gtk2::Gdk::EventMask> object, an arrayref of flag
name strings, or a single flag name string (see L<Glib/This Is Now That>).

=over 4

=item C<< $wevents = Gtk2::Ex::WidgetEvents->new ($widget) >>

=item C<< $wevents = Gtk2::Ex::WidgetEvents->new ($widget, $mask) >>

Create a new C<WidgetEvents> object which adds C<$mask> to C<$widget>.
C<$mask> can be omitted to start a WidgetEvents with no mask bits.

    $wevents = Gtk2::Ex::WidgetEvents->new
                 ($widget, ['button-press-mask']);

The C<$wevents> object only keeps a weak reference to the given C<$widget>,
which means it's safe to keep it in the widget's instance data without
creating a circular reference.

=item C<< $wevents->add ($mask) >>

Add C<$mask> events to those already selected by C<$wevents>.  The target
widget's window is updated immediately if it's realized.

    $wevents->add (['enter-notify-mask', 'leave-notify-mask']);

=item C<< $wevents->remove ($mask) >>

Remove C<$mask> events from those selected by C<$wevents>.  The target
widget's window is updated immediately if it's realized and if nobody else
is interested in each C<$mask> bit.

    $wevents->remove (['enter-notify-mask', 'leave-notify-mask']);

=back

=head1 OTHER NOTES

The event mask for a widget window comes from flags coded into the widget
implementation plus those in the widget C<events> property.  The hard coded
flags are normally for a widget's builtin features, and the C<events>
property is extras wanted by external code.  The C<< $widget->add_events >>
method extends the C<events> property.

WidgetEvents notices both of these on a window and takes them as a base set
of event mask bits.  The base flags are always left installed.  Additional
bits wanted or not by WidgetEvents objects are then set or cleared.
