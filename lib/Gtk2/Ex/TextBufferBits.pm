=head1 NAME

Gtk2::Ex::TextBufferBits -- helpers for Gtk2::TextBuffer objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Gtk2::Ex::TextBufferBits;

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item C<< Gtk2::Ex::TextBufferBits::replace_lines ($textbuf, $str) >>

Replace the text in C<$textbuf> with C<$str>, line by line.  This is the
same as C<< $textbuf->set_text($str) >>, but preserves marks.

Marks within a line move to the start if they're left-gravity, or the end if
right-gravity.  Marks at the very end of the buffer stay at the new end.  If
there's no newline on the last line then right-gravity marks anywhere in it
end up at the new end too.

The insert and selection marks have their column positions preserved too.
The intention would be to do that for all marks, but as of Gtk 2.20 there's
no fast way to get them all.

C<Gtk2::TextView> keeps its window position as a mark at the start of a
line.  C<replace_lines> preserves that, which means the TextView shows the
same lines of the buffer whereas a plain C<< $textbuf->set_text($str) >>
makes it jump to the start of the buffer).
