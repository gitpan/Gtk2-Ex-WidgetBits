=head1 NAME

Gtk2::Ex::FreezeChildNotify -- freeze Gtk child property notifies in scope guard style

=for test_synopsis my ($parent, $widget, $widget1, $widget2)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Gtk2::Ex::FreezeChildNotify;

 { my $freezer = Gtk2::Ex::FreezeChildNotify->new ($widget);
   $parent->child_set_property ($widget, foo => 123);
   $parent->child_set_property ($widget, bar => 456);
   # child-notify signals emitted when $freezer goes out of scope
 }

 # or multiple widgets in one FreezeChildNotify
 {
   my $freezer = Gtk2::Ex::FreezeChildNotify->new ($widget1, $widget2);
   $parent->child_set_property ($widget, foo => 999);
   $parent->child_set_property ($widget, bar => 666);
 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Gtk2::Ex::FreezeChildNotify> applies a C<freeze_child_notify> to given
widgets, with automatic corresponding C<thaw_child_notify> at the end of a
block, no matter how it's exited, whether a C<goto>, early C<return>,
C<die>, etc.

This protects against an error throw leaving the widget permanently frozen.
Even in a simple bit of code an error can be thrown for a bad property name
in a C<child_set_property>, or while calculating a value.  (Though as of
Glib-Perl 1.222 an invalid argument type to C<child_set_property> generally
only provokes warnings.)

=head2 Operation

FreezeChildNotify works by having C<thaw_child_notify> in the destroy code
of the FreezeChildNotify object.

FreezeChildNotify only holds weak references to its widgets, so the mere
fact they're due for later thawing doesn't keep them alive if nothing else
cares whether they live or die.  The effect is that frozen widgets can be
garbage collected within a freeze block at the same point they would be
without any freezing, instead of extending their life to the end of the
block.

It works to have multiple freeze/thaws, done either with FreezeChildNotify
or with explicit C<freeze_child_notify> calls.  C<Gtk2::Widget> simply
counts outstanding freezes, which means they don't have to nest, so multiple
freezes can overlap in any fashion.  If you're freezing for an extended time
then a FreezeChildNotify object is a good way not to lose track of the
thaws, although anything except a short freeze for a handful of
C<child_set_property> calls would be unusual.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item C<< $freezer = Gtk2::Ex::FreezeChildNotify->new ($widget,...) >>

Do a C<< $widget->freeze_child_notify >> on each given widget and return a
FreezeChildNotify object which, when it's destroyed, will
C<< $widget->thaw_child_notify >> each.  So something like

    $widget->freeze_child_notify;
    $parent->child_set_property ($widget, foo => 1);
    $parent->child_set_property ($widget, bar => 2);
    $widget->thaw_child_notify;

becomes instead

    { my $freezer = Gtk2::Ex::FreezeChildNotify->new ($widget);
      $parent->child_set_property ($widget, foo => 1);
      $parent->child_set_property ($widget, bar => 2);
    } # automatic thaw when $freezer goes out of scope

=item C<< $freezer->add ($widget,...) >>

Add additional widgets to the freezer, calling
C<< $widget->freeze_child_notify >> on each, and setting up for
C<< thaw_child_notify >> the same as in C<new> above.

If the widgets to be frozen are not known in advance then it's good to
create an empty freezer with C<new> then add widgets as required.

=back

=head1 OTHER NOTES

When there's multiple widgets in a freezer it's unspecified what order the
C<thaw_child_notify> calls are made.  What would be good?  First-in
first-out, or a stack?  You can create multiple FreezeChildNotify objects
and arrange blocks or explicit discards to destroy them in a particular
order if it matters.

C<Glib::Ex::FreezeNotify> does corresponding freezes on plain property
notifies.

There's quite a few general purpose block-scope cleanup systems if you want
more than just thaws.
L<Scope::Guard|Scope::Guard>,
L<AtExit|AtExit>,
L<End|End>,
L<ReleaseAction|ReleaseAction>,
L<Sub::ScopeFinalizer|Sub::ScopeFinalizer>
and L<Guard|Guard> use the destructor style.
L<Hook::Scope|Hook::Scope>
and L<B::Hooks::EndOfScope|B::Hooks::EndOfScope>
manipulate the code in a block.
L<Unwind::Protect|Unwind::Protect> uses an C<eval> and re-throw.
