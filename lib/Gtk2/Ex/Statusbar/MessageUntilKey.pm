=head1 NAME

Gtk2::Ex::Statusbar::MessageUntilKey -- Statusbar message until key or button

=for test_synopsis my ($statusbar)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Gtk2::Ex::Statusbar::MessageUntilKey;
 Gtk2::Ex::Statusbar::MessageUntilKey->message
    ($statusbar, 'Hello World');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an easy way to display a message in a C<Gtk2::Statusbar>,
automatically cleared when the user presses a key or mouse button.  It's
good for the result of a user action, cleared by the next action.

In a multi-display program (multiple C<Gtk2::Gdk::Display>'s) the message is
only cleared by a key or button from the statusbar's own display.
A statusbar can be moved between displays and is cleared only by its current
display.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item C<< Gtk2::Ex::Statusbar::MessageUntilKey->message ($statusbar, $message) >>

Push string C<$message> onto C<$statusbar> (a C<Gtk2::Statusbar>), and setup
to remove it on the next key press or button press.

If another MessageUntilKey is already displayed in C<$statusbar> then it's
replaced by the new C<$message>.  The new message goes on the top of the
statusbar stack, even if the old one had been buried under other things.

The MessageUntilKey setups only keep a weak reference to C<$statusbar>, so
the mere fact there's a message displayed doesn't keep it alive.

=item C<< Gtk2::Ex::Statusbar::MessageUntilKey->remove ($statusbar) >>

Remove any MessageUntilKey message displayed in C<$statusbar>.  This is
what's done on the next key or button press but you can use this sooner for
explicit removal.  If C<$statusbar> has no MessageUntilKey then C<remove>
does nothing.

=back

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION

Keypresses are detected with a key snooper, and button presses with a
C<button-press-event> emission hook.  Of course only those delivered to the
program are seen, so keypresses in another program don't clear the message.

A button press in a widget without C<button-press-mask> (meaning something
not normally clickable) doesn't reach the client program and so doesn't
clear anything.  This isn't ideal, but clicking an unclickable isn't really
a new user action, so keeping the message may be reasonable.  One
possibility is to add C<button-press-mask> to the toplevel widget (or all
relevant toplevels), even if it doesn't do anything with buttons, so the
event reaches the client.  Perhaps MessageUntilKey could do that itself, or
try selecting on the root window to pick up button presses anywhere at all.

If a statusbar is not under a toplevel window (C<Gtk2::Window>) then
currently it ends up treated as on the default display
(C<< Gtk2::Gdk::Display->get_default >>) and MessageUntilKey cleared by a
key or button from that display.  Would it be better to leave an unparented
statusbar alone?  Of course when unparented it's not visible, so the
contents aren't important until redisplayed later.
