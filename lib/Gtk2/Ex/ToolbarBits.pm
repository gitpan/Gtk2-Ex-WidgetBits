=head1 NAME

Gtk2::Ex::ToolbarBits -- helpers for Gtk2::Toolbar objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Gtk2::Ex::ToolbarBits;

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item C<< Gtk2::Ex::ToolbarBits::move_item_after ($toolbar, $item, $after_item) >>

Move C<$item> to immediately after C<$after_item> within C<$toolbar>.

There's no native move operation in C<Gtk2::Toolbar> so this is done by a
remove and re-insert, if C<$item> isn't already in the right position.

=back

=head1 EXPORTS

Nothing is exported by default, but the functions can be requested in usual
C<Exporter> style,

    use Gtk2::Ex::ToolbarBits 'move_item_after';
    move_item_after ($toolbar, $item, $after_item);

There's no C<:all> tag since this module is meant as a grab-bag of functions
and to import as-yet unknown things would be asking for name clashes.
