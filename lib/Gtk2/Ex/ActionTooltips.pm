=head1 NAME

Gtk2::Ex::ActionTooltips -- propagate Action tooltips to MenuItems

=for test_synopsis my ($actiongroup, $action1, $action2, $action3)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Gtk2::Ex::ActionTooltips;
 Gtk2::Ex::ActionTooltips::group_tooltips_to_menuitems
     ($actiongroup);
 Gtk2::Ex::ActionTooltips::action_tooltips_to_menuitems_dynamic
     ($action1, $action2, $action2);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This spot of code sets tooltips from L<C<Gtk2::Action>|Gtk2::Action>s onto
L<C<Gtk2::MenuItem>|Gtk2::MenuItem>s connected to those actions.  Normally
the action connection sets tooltips onto
L<C<Gtk2::ToolItem>|Gtk2::ToolItem>s, but not MenuItems.

The widget C<tooltip-text> mechanism is used, which is new in Gtk 2.12 and
up.  For earlier Gtk the functions here do nothing.

Whether you want tooltips on MenuItems depends on personal preference or how
much explanation the actions need.  A MenuItem tooltip is fairly unintrusive
though, and pops up only after the usual delay.

There's other ways to show what a menu item might do of course.  For
instance the Gtk manual under the GtkActionGroup connect-proxy signal
describes showing action tooltips in a statusbar.

=head1 EXPORTS

Nothing is exported by default and the functions can be called with a fully
qualified name as shown.  Or they can be imported in usual
L<Exporter|Exporter> style, including tag C<:all> for all functions.

    use Gtk2::Ex::ActionTooltips 'group_tooltips_to_menuitems';
    group_tooltips_to_menuitems ($actiongroup);

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item C<< Gtk2::Ex::ActionTooltips::group_tooltips_to_menuitems ($actiongroup) >>

Setup C<$actiongroup> (a L<C<Gtk2::ActionGroup>|Gtk2::ActionGroup>) so
tooltips in its actions are installed on any connected C<Gtk2::MenuItem>s.

    my $actiongroup = Gtk2::ActionGroup->new ("main");
    Gtk2::Ex::ActionTooltips::group_tooltips_to_menuitems
        ($actiongroup);

The tooltips are applied to current and future connected MenuItems, for all
current and future actions in the group.  But the tooltips in the actions
are assumed to be unchanging.  If you change a tooltip then the change is
not propagated to already-connected menu items.

=item C<< Gtk2::Ex::ActionTooltips::action_tooltips_to_menuitems_dynamic ($action1, $action2, ...) >>

Setup each given C<$action> (C<Gtk2::Action> object) so its tooltip property
is installed on any connected C<Gtk2::MenuItms>s dynamically.

    Gtk2::Ex::ActionTooltips::action_tooltips_to_menuitems_dynamic
      ($my_help_action,
       $my_frobnicate_action);

The tooltips are applied to currently connected MenuItems, and any future
connected MenuItems, and the setup is "dynamic" in that if you change the
action tooltip then the change is propagated to connected MenuItems.

    $my_help_action->set (tooltip => 'New text');

C<action_tooltips_to_menuitems_dynamic> makes a signal connection on each
Action.  To keep down overheads you probably only want it on actions which
might change their tooltips.  If you want dynamic propagation for all
Actions in an ActionGroup you could use

    Gtk2::Ex::ActionTooltips::action_tooltips_to_menuitems_dynamic
      ($actiongroup->list_actions);

Of course this is only actions currently in the ActionGroup, not future
added ones.  As of Gtk 2.16 there's no callback from an ActionGroup when an
action is added to it, so there's no easy way to cover future added actions
too.
