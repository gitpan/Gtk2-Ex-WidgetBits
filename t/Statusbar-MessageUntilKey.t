# This diabolical bit of code is what it takes to synthesize a
# Gtk2::Gdk::Event::Key which gtk_bindings_activate_event() will dispatch.
# That func looks at the hardware_keycode and group, rather than the
# keyval in the event, so must generate those.  hardware_keycode values
# are basically arbitrary aren't they?  At any rate the strategy is to
# lookup what hardware code is Return in the display keymap and use that.
# gtk_bindings_activate_event() then ends up then going the other way,
# turning the hardware code into a keyval to lookup in the bindingset!
#
# The gtk_widget_get_display() docs say $mywidget won't have a display
# until it's the child of a toplevel.  Gtk 2.12 will give you back the
# default display before then, but probably better not to rely on that.
